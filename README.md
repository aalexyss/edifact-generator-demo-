Generation of EDIFACT messages (COPARN, VERMAS) from fictitious data, with business logic and automation


This is a demo project for generating EDIFACT messages (COPARN, VERMAS, and others) from structured logistics data.  
It simulates how container and shipment data can be processed and transformed into standardized EDI formats using Java.

##Features

- Generates multiple EDIFACT message types
- Clean structure for adding more message types (IFTMIN, IFCSUM, etc.)
- Container data simulation for realistic output
- Easy to extend and adapt to different logistics flows
